I’m a robotics engineer with a passion for building real-world robotic systems that combine intelligent behavior, precise control, and reliable planning. My work focuses on robotic manipulation, arm control, trajectory planning, and full-stack ROS 2 architecture.

At **Unlimited Robotics**, I lead the development of an integrated robotics platform. I’ve built high-level task generators in MoveIt, implemented control pipelines for multi-DOF arms, and designed systems for real-time performance and modularity. I also manage cross-functional coordination between manipulation, navigation, and perception.

I thrive at the intersection of planning and control — where motion becomes action. Some of my strengths include:
- Designing and integrating task pipelines using ROS 2, MoveIt, and custom control logic
- Developing controllers for manipulators and mobile bases (trajectory, impedance, admittance)
- Writing robust, testable, and modular robotic software
- Deep understanding of robot kinematics and control

In my Master's at <a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/">Tel Aviv University</a>, I researched **in-hand manipulation using vibration-driven fingers** for grasping thin objects. This work resulted in a **patented design for high-resolution robotic fingers**, combining theoretical modeling with real-world performance.

Though most of my embedded experience comes from **hands-on prototyping**, I've developed custom FOC motor drivers, built real-time firmware on ESP32, and implemented sensor and actuator interfaces (CAN/CANFD, ADCs, encoders).

I previously worked on the control and telemetry system of a **Formula Student electric race car**, leading the embedded and electronics design between 2019 and 2022.

I’m especially curious to expand my knowledge and experience in:
- **Control Theory - Optimization** - for robot optimization control 
- **Reinforcement Learning** for robotic decision-making
- **SLAM and autonomous navigation**
- **planning for mobile manipulation**

I'm always open to tackling complex robotics problems that push both theory and engineering. Let’s build robots that actually work.

    abstract={•
A novel mechanism for augmenting standard parallel grippers is proposed.
•
The mechanism is vibration-based, low-cost and enables in-hand manipulation.
•
Theoretical and dynamical analysis is derived for the proposed system.
•
A controller is proposed to manipulate objects to goal positions and along paths.
•
Experimental analysis on various objects is performe}
